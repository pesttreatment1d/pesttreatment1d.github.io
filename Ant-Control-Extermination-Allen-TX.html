After handling several nationwide chain exterminators and being largely dissatisfied with the service, I turned to Terminators for help with pest concerns at my workplace. The idea of IPM is to monitor and control pests only when they begin appearing and removing the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM strategies, Scope of works, application techniques and market specific record keeping treatments.</p>
<p>Established in 1967, it is the leading association of the professional pest management markets, with over 300 members throughout the country. Security precedes for us. We just use government-approved and environmentally-friendly pesticides and items for our treatments that are safe for children and pets too.
