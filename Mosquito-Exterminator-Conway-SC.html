<p>The lots of varying dangers from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage organizations to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these nations, routine usage of pesticides is limited to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly centered on cotton, soybean, sugarcane, and rice.</p>
<p>Todays professionals utilize Integrated Pest Management methods that include traps and exemption methods to control pests. 2Standard Covered Pests consist of cockroaches, mice, rats, silverfish, "home" ants (excluding carpenter ants, fire ants, pharaoh ants & tawny insane ants), clothes moths, non-poisonous spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, home crickets and paper wasps.</p>
