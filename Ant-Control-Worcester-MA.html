<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in such a way that lessens their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in reality need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the ingredients or packaging, and the facility itself will draw in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
<p>More information is required about food-chain concentration and useful ways of eliminating destructive results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their function. Do not base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest.
