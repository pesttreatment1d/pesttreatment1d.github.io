Farming takes on the concern with incorporated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one reason for problems consisting of illness, unwanted insects, termites, nematodes, weeds and mollusks. A number of treatment techniques have been used, including chemical methods, such as pesticide applications and poisonous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or warming the materials, making use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, modified environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>Hence IPM is finest mix of all possible techniques in pest management with least reliance on chemical pesticide. Management choices must be based upon monitoring and population levels of insect pests, in addition to trustworthy thresholds. IPM addresses all the financial, ecological, and social elements and offers safe and budget friendly food to the earnings and customers to manufacturers and sellers, while maintaining ecological health.</p>
<p>Socio-psychological factors including moral and reasonable factors to consider were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise showed that a lack of qualified IPM professionals and extension educators was an impediment for IPM execution in industrialized nations.</p>
